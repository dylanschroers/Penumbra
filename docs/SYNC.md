# Penumbra — Sync engine (Plane A)

How owned, local-first data (today: tasks) reconciles across a user's devices.
This is the design the code references throughout; read it before touching
anything under `apps/web/src/sync`, `apps/server/src/sync`, or the sync columns
in `packages/shared`.

## Why a custom delta-sync, not PowerSync / ElectricSQL

PowerSync and ElectricSQL are the obvious off-the-shelf options, but both mean
running an extra sync service, and PowerSync would replace the working OPFS +
Drizzle client store with its own SDK. For **one user, their own devices,
last-write-wins**, that is far more than the problem needs. So v0 is a small
pull/push delta-sync that rides the existing REST server and existing client
SQLite store. Swapping in a heavier engine later stays contained to the
`sync/` modules.

## The model

Every owned row carries two sync columns (see
`packages/shared/src/schema/tasks.ts`):

- **`deletedAt`** — soft-delete tombstone. `null` = live. A deleted row stays in
  the table (filtered out of `listTasks`) so the deletion itself can propagate.
- **`rev`** — a server-assigned, monotonically increasing integer. It is the
  **pull cursor**: a client asks for every row with `rev` greater than the
  highest it has stored. `null` on a row created locally and not yet accepted by
  the server.

The server is the single **merge authority**. It owns `rev` and resolves
conflicts. Clients never invent a `rev`.

## A sync round

`apps/web/src/sync/SyncClient.ts` runs one round as **push, then pull**:

1. **Push** — drain the client-only `_outbox` table (every local mutation appends
   the touched row id there) and `POST /sync/tasks` with those full rows. On a
   `2xx`, clear exactly the outbox seqs that were collected — a mutation that
   landed mid-push has a higher seq and survives to the next round, so no edit is
   lost.
2. **Pull** — `GET /sync/tasks?since=<cursor>` where `cursor = MAX(rev)` the
   client has stored. Apply returned rows locally with the same LWW rule. Pushing
   first means the round's pull also brings back the server `rev` for the rows
   just pushed, so local rows pick up their authoritative version.

Triggers: on startup, on a 15s interval, on the `online` event, and debounced
(~800ms) right after a local edit. Only the tab that owns the local store runs
the loop — the single-tab guard guarantees that's the one rendering the app.

## Server-side writes: the agent's turn

The server-side agent runs its tools against the *server's* database while the
user is looking at the *client's*. Sync closes the gap in both directions, but
only on its 15s interval, so each direction needs an explicit prod:

- **Pre-turn flush (client to server).** Before a turn starts, the client pushes
  pending edits and the server applies them, so the model reasons about what the
  user actually sees rather than up-to-15s-stale state.
- **Post-tool nudge (server to client).** After each tool event, the client
  pulls, so a created task appears immediately. The local tier gets this free —
  its `runTool` wrote to the local store and calls `notifyDataChanged()`. The
  server tier has no local write, so `RemoteEngine` calls `requestSync()` on
  every tool event. **Without this the round trip looks broken**: the answer
  arrives and the task shows up fifteen seconds later.

### The rev trap

`pull` selects `WHERE rev > ?`, and revs are assigned **only** inside
`applyPush`. A server-side write that inserts a row directly leaves `rev` NULL,
and that row is then invisible to every client forever, with no error raised
anywhere. Every server write therefore goes through the rev-stamping path —
`apps/server/src/store/tasks.ts` states the rule at the top and routes its CRUD
through `TaskSyncStore.push()` to honour it. Assume this one gets hit if it is
not designed for.

Two related traps in the same area: `pull` returns rev-ordered rows *including
tombstones*, so a `list_tasks` tool needs live rows only; and `userId` has no
server-side source, so the server store adopts the same `"local"` constant the
client stamps until auth exists.

## Conflict resolution: last-write-wins

Per row, by `updatedAt` (ISO-8601 strings, which sort chronologically). On both
client (`upsertFromServer`) and server (`applyPush`):

> keep the stored row only when it is **strictly newer** than the incoming one;
> otherwise the incoming edit wins, ties included.

Ties go to the incoming write so the server, as merge authority, stays
deterministic. A delete is just an `updatedAt` bump plus a `deletedAt` stamp, so
delete-vs-edit races resolve by the same rule (newest wins, and a newer edit can
revive a row).

### Clock skew

`updatedAt` is wall-clock, so skew between devices only ever changes *which* edit
wins a close race — acceptable for a single user. It can **never drop a change**,
because the pull cursor is the server's `rev` sequence, not a timestamp.

## Epochs: surviving a replaced server database

Revs are only meaningful relative to the database that issued them. If the
server's database is replaced behind the same URL (deleted and recreated, moved
to a new machine, a different server on the same port), two client invariants
break silently:

1. **Cursor monotonicity** — the client's cursor may be higher than the new
   database will reach for a while, so pulls return nothing (deaf client).
2. **Push durability** — the outbox is cleared on ack, but the acknowledged
   copy died with the old database, so those rows are never offered again
   (stranded rows).

So the server mints a random `instance_id` when its database is created (`meta`
table, `apps/server/src/db.ts`) and returns it as `serverId` on every response.
A restored backup keeps its id — its revs are still valid. The client stores
the last adopted id in the client-only `_sync_meta` table; when a pull returns
an unfamiliar one (including the first sync ever), it **reconciles**
(`adoptServer` in the DB worker): null every local `rev` (which also resets the
pull cursor to 0), re-enqueue every row — tombstones included — into the
outbox, store the new id, then run one more push+pull. LWW makes the full
re-exchange converge, whatever order devices reconnect in.

Cost in the steady state: one string field per response. Caveat: a device that
last synced before the old database died re-seeds everything it still has,
including rows whose deletion happened after its last sync — the tombstones
died with the old database. Inherent to losing server history; LWW keeps it
deterministic.

## Endpoints

`apps/server/src/sync/tasks.ts`:

- `GET /sync/tasks?since=N` → `{ rows, cursor, serverId }` — rows with `rev > N`
  in `rev` order; `cursor` is the new high-water mark.
- `POST /sync/tasks` body `{ rows }` → `{ cursor, serverId }` — validates
  against the shared `pushTasksInput` schema, then LWW-upserts in one
  transaction, assigning each accepted write the next `rev`.

The wire shape is `syncTask` in `packages/shared/src/validation/sync.ts` — a full
stored row, so its optional columns (`notes`, `dueAt`) are **nullable**, matching
what SQLite returns, not just `.optional()`.

## Storage

- **Client:** browser SQLite (OPFS SAHPool) in the DB worker. Migrations
  `0001_*` add the sync columns; `0002_outbox.sql` adds the client-only `_outbox`
  (deliberately not in the shared schema — the server has no outbox);
  `0003_sync_meta.sql` adds the client-only `_sync_meta` (last adopted
  `serverId`, see Epochs above).
- **Server:** `better-sqlite3`, one file (`DB_PATH`, default `server.db`,
  gitignored). One table, driven by the raw driver; the shared Zod schema governs
  the wire format so the two stores cannot drift. Moving to Postgres later is
  contained to `apps/server/src/db.ts`.

## v0 limitations (read before exposing this beyond localhost/LAN)

- **No auth.** The sync endpoints trust anyone who can reach them. Fine for
  `localhost` or a trusted LAN. Before this ever faces the open internet, add a
  bearer token (cheap) or the Identity module (device registration + per-device
  sync state, per ARCHITECTURE.md).
- **CORS does not reflect any origin** — it used to, which was a hole rather
  than a limitation, since a page the user merely visited could then drive the
  actuator routes over loopback. It is now an allowlist of the app's own
  origins plus `PENUMBRA_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (`apps/server/src/http/cors.ts`).
  Serving the web build from anywhere else means naming that origin there.
- **Single user.** Every row carries `userId` (`"local"`), but nothing scopes
  requests to a caller yet. Multi-user is a query-scoping change, not a schema
  one.
- **Tasks only.** Other Plane A tables adopt sync by adding the same two columns
  and a matching endpoint pair.
